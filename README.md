# kiplex-junior-engineering-challenge

## Introduction
- This is the coding test for prospective KipleX engineers.
- This test is unstructured.
- You’re encouraged to be creative and demonstrate skills and talent.
- You’re encouraged to create additional functionality and extend the problem statement.

### Purpose
- Primary purpose: to gauge the candidate’s ability to learn and grasp a new technology or skill.
- Secondary purpose: to gauge the candidate’s technical skills and competencies.

## Problem Statement
- You’re supposed to create a “To do list” application.
- The app must be a web application using single page application approach.
- The app should allow the user to create new to-do items.
- The app should display the to-do list items once created.
- The app should allow the user to edit any to-do item and save the changes.
- The app should allow the user to delete a to-do item.
- To-do items can be nested i.e. one to-do list can have child to-do list items.
- The create, read, update, delete functionality should apply to the child items too.
- The to-do list should persist in the application when the page close/open or app shutdown/run.
- You’re not allowed to used a database to store the data. 
- This problem must be solved within the boundaries of the web browser.

## Expected Solution
- Your solution should be written using Angular framework.
- Your solution should use TypeScript.
- Your solution should include instructions download, initialise and run.
- Your solution should provide documentation on how the code is written and structured.

## Instructions
- Clone this [repo](git@github.com:dextercodo/kiplex-junior-engineering-challenge.git)
- Complete the solution as quickly as possible, max 5 days.
- Make a fork, and then create a PR for the fork when you are ready for answer submission!
- Notify dexter.karim@kiplex.com upon PR request with link to PR and demonstration of PR ownership.
